I struggled a bit in order to figure out what the best license for this project would be, so I went for Mozilla Public License. 

This basically allows you to use this lib in any project you want (Proprietary or free).
This also allows you to keep your GPL / LGPL license as is if you plan to use this library.
The only requirement is to keep modifications of this library as open source.
Please feel free to contribute, and to ping me if this licensing is causing you trouble, I would be glad to help !
